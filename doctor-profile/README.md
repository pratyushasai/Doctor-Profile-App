Implementation Details: -


This application built using two components one is the Scheduler component and the other is a modal component.
 I have considered that users can only input the start hour and end hour. (This could have been improved). I tried to focus much on implementation than adding more features to the application.
 I have implemented redux architecture for the state management in the scheduler component because it removes the hassle of state management.
 A store has been created along with the reducer.
 I made application responsive by media queries.
 I have used refs in the modal component.
 Validations have been considered while filling add availability modal
 Data structure has been designed to serve the purpose and modified the high-level data structure to map it as a table.
 Bootstrap elements are used to make them responsive
Reusable dropdown component has been constructed.
Area of Improvements: -
Functionality could have improved better while constructing the table. Instead of taking them as individual hours, a continuous-time should have been taken.
 state management in the modal component would have been controlled by the store.
